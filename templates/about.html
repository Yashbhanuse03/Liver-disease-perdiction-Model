                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The Liver Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of liver disease based on various medical parameters. This system uses a trained model to analyze patient data and provide a prediction of whether the patient may have liver disease.
                </p>
                
                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>
                    The system uses a machine learning model trained on the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD). The model analyzes the following parameters:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Age and Gender</li>
                    <li>Bilirubin levels (Total and Direct)</li>
                    <li>Enzyme levels (Alkaline Phosphotase, Alamine Aminotransferase, Aspartate Aminotransferase)</li>
                    <li>Protein levels (Total Proteins, Albumin)</li>
                    <li>Albumin and Globulin Ratio</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Based on these parameters, the model calculates the probability of liver disease and provides a prediction.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Model Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    The prediction model has been trained and evaluated on a dataset of liver patients. The model achieves:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accuracy: ~69%</li>
                    <li>Precision: ~73% for detecting no disease</li>
                    <li>Recall: ~90% for detecting no disease</li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                <h3>About Liver Disease</h3>
                <p>
                    Liver disease refers to any condition that damages the liver and affects its function. The liver is responsible for many critical functions within the body, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Filtering the blood</li>
                    <li>Processing nutrients, medications, and hormones</li>
                    <li>Producing bile to help digest fats</li>
                    <li>Storing vitamins and minerals</li>
                    <li>Removing toxins from the body</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Common types of liver disease include hepatitis, fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Early detection and treatment of liver disease can help prevent progression to more serious conditions.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Risk Factors for Liver Disease</h3>
                <p>
                    Several factors can increase the risk of developing liver disease:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heavy alcohol consumption</li>
                    <li>Obesity</li>
                    <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
                    <li>Viral infections (hepatitis A, B, C)</li>
                    <li>Exposure to certain chemicals or toxins</li>
                    <li>Family history of liver disease</li>
                </ul>
